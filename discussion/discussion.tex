\section{Summary of the results}

The objective of this PhD work was to study the evolution of all glaciers in the French Alps from the last decades of the 20$^{th}$ century until the end of the 21$^{st}$ century, and to explore the impact of their retreat in the hydrological budget of the Rh√¥ne river catchment. However, this initial objective was adapted following the exploration of machine learning methods for glacier mass balance simulation at the end of the first year of the project. My strong interest on this rather unexploited methods in glaciology lead to important changes in the results, largely expanding the efforts dedicated on methods, and reducing the amount of results on hydroglaciological modelling. Consequently, the resulting scientific questions that were addressed during these three years also evolved. In this section, I will address each one of these questions, giving an overview of the results and determining the accomplished objectives as well as the remaining challenges.

\subsubsection{Question 1 - Can deep learning be applied to model annual glacier mass balance changes at a regional scale? What are the benefits of using nonlinear deep learning models compared to linear machine learning?}

In Chapter 2, based on a paper published in \textit{The Cryosphere} journal, we introduced, to our knowledge, the first effort ever to apply deep learning to simulate glacier evolution. A new open-source regional glacier evolution model was developed, whose main novelty was a mass balance component based on machine learning. Our work showed promising results, proving that deep learning can be successfully used to simulate glacier mass balance. A detailed comparison between linear machine learning methods and deep learning highlighted how important nonlinearities are captured by deep learning. Since both the climate and glacier systems are known to be highly nonlinear, this resulted in an improved performance from deep learning models. Moreover, despite using a rather small dataset of annual mass balance data, we proved that by rigorously cross-validating the models, deep learning can still learn from "small data" without overfitting. Spatiotemporal data demands that the independence of both dimensions have to be respected during cross-validation. We devised different types of cross-validation which enabled us to accurately evaluate the performance of models in the spatial and temporal dimensions, while fully utilizing the whole dataset to train the models. 

\subsubsection{Question 2 - What are the annual glacier changes of all glaciers in the French Alps during the last 50 years?}

In Chapter 3, based on a paper published in the \textit{Earth System Science Data} journal, we applied the deep learning methods developed in Chapter 2 to the reconstruction of annual glacier-wide MB series of all glaciers in the French Alps between 1967 and 2015. Our results showed that French alpine glaciers went through slightly negative MB rates from the late 1960s and during the 1970s (-0.44 m.w.e. a$^{-1}$). Then, during the 1980s  their MB was almost stable (-0.16 m.w.e. a$^{-1}$, with several positive years), before becoming more negative from the 1990s (-0.71 m.w.e. $^{-1}$). Their MB rates became remarkably more negative from the 2000s (-1.18 m.w.e. a$^{-1}$), especially after the famous heatwave from the year 2003. This year established an inflection point, from which MB become increasingly negative up to -1.26 m.w.e. a$^{-1}$ for the first half of the 2010s. Important differences were found between massifs, with the Mont-Blanc massif showing the least negative MB, and the Chablais massif presenting the highest losses. We showed how this method correctly captured the interannual variability of the glacier-wide MB signal of glaciers in the French Alps, mostly driven by climate, and how it also captured differences between glaciers with various topographical characteristics. 

\subsubsection{Question 3 - How will French alpine glaciers evolve during the 21st century? How does glacier retreat affect the climate signal on glaciers? What are the main factors that determine glacier survival in the French Alps?}

\section{Perspectives on future research venues}

This PhD work served to bring attention to the benefits of using deep learning for regression problems in glacier evolution modelling. At the beginning of this PhD, to my knowledge, there were no papers published using deep learning on glaciers. For the AGU Fall Meeting 2019, a new session on machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) and remote sensing on the cryosphere was created for the first time. This session served to catalyse all the current research in this sub-field, with many papers published around that period. For the first time, researchers working on these topics were able to exchange, discuss and even collaborate in bringing new methods to different applications in glaciology. This experience was followed by another session on machine learning and AI for glaciology at the EGU General Meeting 2020, which despite the virtual format due to the global COVID-19 crisis, further displayed the huge potential of these applications from a wide range of glaciological problems. Machine learning in glaciology is still a very novel field, but many promising applications are being presented by the day \citep[e.g.][]{leong_deepbedmap_2020, brinkerhoff_constraining_2020}, showing multiple directions for the sub-field to evolve towards. 

So far, as it was shown in these two previous sessions at AGU and EGU, the great majority of efforts have been focused on classification problems. New satellite imagery, with ever improving spatial and temporal resolution, is being successfully exploited by deep learning methods to automatically extract glacier fronts in Greenland and Antarctica \citep[e.g.][]{lea_google_2018,baumhoer_automated_2019,mohajerani_detection_2019, zhang_automatically_2019} and supraglacial lakes \cite[e.g.][]{yuan_automatic_2020}. Conversely, regression problems in glaciology remain highly unexplored, due to the inherent complexity of correctly representing physical processes with data science models. The work of this PhD showed how deep learning models can be extremely challenging to interpret. We attempted to do so by training a parallel linear machine learning model (Lasso) with the same dataset, and by thoroughly cross-validating it respecting spatiotemporal structures in data. Nonetheless, these represented just approximations of what the true underlying model actually is, and raised many questions on how to address these issues. 

Fortunately, in the last years enormous progress has been made towards interpretable machine learning and particularly interpretable NNs. NNs are universal function approximators, meaning that any sufficiently large NN can approximate any nonlinear function with a finite set of parameters \citep{winkler_performance_2017}. This remarkable predicting power comes at the cost of very low interpretability, demanding deep changes in the way we design NNs. In order to represent a partially known physical process with a NN, two main approaches are being proposed nowadays: (1) NNs are optimized following a certain loss function, which determines how they learn and update the weights of the different connections between neurons. By consciously modifying a NN's architecture, one can constrain the way NNs learn based on prior knowledge. The most prominent way so far has been to encode prior knowledge, in the form of differential equations (DEs), as the loss function of a NN. By doing so, the learning of NNs is constrained following currently known equations \citep{raissi_physics_2017,karpatne_physics-guided_2018}. Additionally, by using specific architectures that suit the specificities of a given physical process, the learning can be further constrained, limiting or enhancing the interactions between certain input predictors \citep{karpatne_theory-guided_2017}. Such an approach enables an equation-guided learning, but does not fully deal with the "black box" consequences on interpretability. (2) Another way of looking at this problem is that, instead of trying to constrain the learning of NNs, NNs can be reduced to the smallest possible entities, in order to decrease their complexity to the point they can be interpreted. This radically different approach is currently showing very exciting results. The beauty of this approach resides on the fact that it manages to create hybrid models, mixing a classical physical approach based on DEs with the phenomenal predictive power of NNs to optimize unknown parameters \citep{rackauckas_universal_2020}. The main structure of such a model remains a DE, which is augmented with NNs that replace the unknowns parameters. New methods enable the optimization of DEs mixed with NNs, allowing the NNs to produce nonlinear functions that optimize the unknowns following an equation determined by the DE. Since these NNs are based on just one or two input parameters, their output nonlinear functions can be sampled using Monte Carlo methods at their input. By applying a sparse regression on its outputs , one can obtain a mathematical representation of the nonlinear function learnt by the NN \citep{brunton_discovering_2016}. This mathematical representation of NNs can be used to interpret them, while suggesting reformulations in the currently known equations used in the model \citep{rackauckas_universal_2020}. 


\subsubsection{Question 4 - What are the caveats of this deep learning modelling approach? What improvements are needed to overcome these limitations for glaciological studies?}

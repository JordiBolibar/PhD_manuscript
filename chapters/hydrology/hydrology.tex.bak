\section{Introduction}

Glaciers supply water that supports ecosystems and human communities both nearby and far away from glaciers. The strong climatic diversity of glacierized alpine catchments enables the storage of precipitation in the form of snow, firn and ice at high altitudes. This water storage is progressively released throughout the year during the warmest months, providing a more constant runoff than non-glacierized catchments. At the beginning of the melt season, snow provides important water resources downstream. Once most of the snow has melted, leaving bare glacier ice exposed, glaciers continue providing freshwater resources, ensuring an uninterrupted runoff throughout the melt season. This role of glaciers as late summer buffers is currently being challenged by anthropogenic climate change. Glacier retreat in the European Alps is transforming the hydrological regime of high-mountain catchments, with potential environmental and social impacts. 

In the French Alps, the local population have a strong dependency on water resources, using them for the ski business, hydropower generation and domestic use. Glacier retreat has the potential to alter the hydrological regime of glacierized catchments. Anticipating these future changes in hydrological regimes is of paramount importance in order to correctly adapt future water consumption and needs. Hydrological models can provide answers to these questions, showing the outcomes of different future climate scenarios. Nonetheless, hydrological models that are used at operation level often have a very simplified representation of glaciers, including them as static ice reservoirs. Such a representation is problematic in the current context of glacier retreat, neglecting future changes in hydrological regimes driven by glaciers. The J2K hydrological model, developed at the University of Jena (Germany), is being used by a large community of hydrologists in France for a wide variety of geographical setups. Here, we present an attempt to overcome these limitations of the J2K model, including a dynamic representation of glaciers. We introduce and validate this new implementation in a partially-glacierized alpine catchment in the French Alps: the Arvan catchment in the Grandes Rousses massif. 

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Study area}

The Arvan catchment(Fig. \ref{hydro:fig1}) is a partially glacierized alpine catchment, situated in the Grandes Rousses massif, between 1368 and 3373 m.a.s.l. It includes the Saint Sorlin glacier (2.069 km$^{2}$ in 2015), being the glacier with the second longest mass balance observation series in France (1957-present). Two villages are located within the catchment: Saint-Sorlin-d'Arves and Saint-Jean-d'Arves, with the latter including runoff measurements for the 2000-2016 period. This station measured an average interannual runoff of 1.864 m$^{3}$/s, with 10\% of temporal gaps in the data series (Fig. \ref{hydro:fig1}). This study site has been chosen due to its wealth of data, providing an excellent testbed to validate the modelling approach.

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.]},

            In this study we present 19 new or re-analysed series of glacier-wide seasonal mass balance for the Swiss Alps based on direct measurements. The records partly start around 1920 and continue until today. Previously unpublished and unevaluated observations of point winter and annual balance are compiled from various sources and archives. These highly valuable datasets have not yet been consistently evaluated and were thus unavailable to the scientific community. Using distributed modelling for spatial interpolation and extrapolation and homogenization of the point measurements, we infer continuous series of area-averaged mass balance. The results are validated against independent decadal ice volume changes from photogrammetric surveys. Six of the new seasonal series cover 60 years and more and add a substantial amount of information on the variations of regional glacier mass change. This will strengthen the worldwide collection of glacier monitoring data, especially for the data-sparse period before the 1980s. We compare our results to existing long-term series and present an updated assessment of mass-balance variability and glacier sensitivity throughout the European Alps.},

The model relies solely on monthly precipitation and air temperatures as forcing. We first train the model individually for 15 glaciers with existing mass balance measurements. Based on a cross validation, we present a thorough assessment of the model's performance outside of the training period. The cross validation indicates that our model is robust, and our model's performance compares favorably to that from a less parsimonious model based on seasonal sensitivity characteristics. Then, the model is extended for application on glaciers without existing mass balance measurements. We cross validated the model again by withholding the mass balance information from each of the 15 glaciers above during the model training, in order to measure its performance on glaciers not included in the model training. This cross validation indicates that the model retains considerable skill even when applied on glaciers without mass balance measurements. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} As an exemplary application, the model is then used to reconstruct time series of interannual mass balance variability, covering the past two hundred years, for all glaciers in the European Alps contained in the extended format of the world glacier inventory.

              We propose to quantify the climate sensitivity of the mean specific balance
              B
              of a glacier by a seasonal sensitivity characteristic (SSC). The SSC gives the dependence of
              B
              on monthly anomalies in temperature and precipitation. It is calculated from a mass-balance model. We show and discuss examples for Franz-Josef Glacier (New Zealand), Nigardsbreen (Norway), Hintereisferner (Austria), Peyto Glacier (Canadian Rockies), Abramov Glacier (Kirghizstan) and White Glacier (Canadian Arctic). With regard to the climate sensitivity of

              , the SSCs clearly show that summer temperature is the most important factor for glaciers in a dry climate. For glaciers in a wetter climate, spring and fall temperatures also make a significant contribution to the overall sensitivity. The SSC is a 2 × 12 matrix. Multiplying it with monthly perturbations of temperature and precipitation for a particular year yields an estimate of the balance for that year. We show that, with this technique, mass-balance series can be (re)constructed from long meteorological records or from output of atmospheric models.},

While most glacier models tend to incorporate more and more physical processes, here we take an alternative approach by creating a parameterized model based on data science. Annual glacier-wide SMBs can be simulated using either deep learning or Lasso (regularized multilinear regression), whereas the glacier geometry is updated using a glacier-specific parameterization. We compare and cross-validate our nonlinear deep learning SMB model against other standard linear statistical methods on a dataset of 32 French alpine glaciers. Deep learning is found to outperform linear methods, with improved explained variance (up to +64\&amp;thinsp;\% in space and +108\&amp;thinsp;\% in time) and accuracy (up to +47\&amp;thinsp;\% in space and +58\&amp;thinsp;\% in time), resulting in an estimated r$^{\textrm{2}}$ of 0.77 and RMSE of 0.51\&amp;thinsp;m.w.e. Substantial nonlinear structures are captured by deep learning, with around 35\&amp;thinsp;\% of nonlinear behaviour in the temporal dimension. For the glacier geometry evolution, the main uncertainties come from the ice thickness data used to initialize the model. These results should encourage the use of deep learning in glacier modelling as a powerful nonlinear tool, capable of capturing the nonlinearities of the climate and glacier systems, that can serve to reconstruct or simulate SMB time series for individual glaciers at a regional scale for past and future climates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The model is validated using a leave-one-glacier-out cross-validation scheme against 3997 observed surface mass balances of 255 glaciers, and against 756 geodetically observed, temporally integrated volume and surface area changes of 341 glaciers. When forced with observed monthly precipitation and temperature data, the glaciers of the world are reconstructed to have lost mass corresponding to 114 ± 5 mm sea-level equivalent (SLE) between 1902 and 2009. Using projected temperature and precipitation anomalies from 15 coupled general circulation models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble, they are projected to lose an additional 148 ± 35 mm SLE (scenario RCP26), 166 ± 42 mm SLE (scenario RCP45), 175 ± 40 mm SLE (scenario RCP60), or 217 ± 47 mm SLE (scenario RCP85) during the 21st century. Based on the extended RCP scenarios, glaciers are projected to approach a new equilibrium towards the end of the 23rd century, after having lost either 248 ± 66 mm SLE (scenario RCP26), 313 ± 50 mm SLE (scenario RCP45), or 424 ± 46 mm SLE (scenario RCP85). Up until approximately 2100, ensemble uncertainty within each scenario is the biggest source of uncertainty for the future glacier mass loss; after that, the difference between the scenarios takes over as the biggest source of uncertainty.

Until recently, comprehensive uncertainty assessments have rarely been carried out and mass balance data have often been applied using rough error estimation or without consideration of errors. In this study, we propose a framework for reanalysing glacier mass balance series that includes conceptual and statistical toolsets for assessment of random and systematic errors, as well as for validation and calibration (if necessary) of the glaciological with the geodetic balance results. We demonstrate the usefulness and limitations of the proposed scheme, drawing on an analysis that comprises over 50 recording periods for a dozen glaciers, and we make recommendations to investigators and users of glacier mass balance data. Reanalysing glacier mass balance series needs to become a standard procedure for every monitoring programme to improve data quality, including reliable uncertainty estimates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

            Hourly melt and discharge of Storglaciären, a small glacier in Sweden, were computed for two melt seasons, applying temperature-index methods to a 30 m resolution grid for the melt component. The classical degree-day method yielded a good simulation of the seasonal patient of discharge, but the pronounced melt-induced daily discharge cycles were not captured. Modelled degree-day factors calculated for every hour and each gridcell from melt obtained from a distributed energy-balance model varied substantially, both diurnally and spatially. A new distributed temperature-index model is suggested, attempting to capture both the pronounced diurnal melt cycles and the spatial variations in melt due to the effects of surrounding topography. This is accomplished by including a radiation index in terms of potential clear-sky direct solar radiation, and thus, without the need for other data besides air temperature. This approach improved considerably the simulation of diurnal discharge fluctuations and yielded a more realistic spatial distribution of melt rates. The incorporation of measured global radiation to account for the reduction in direct solar radiation due to cloudiness did not lead to additional improvement in model performance.},

Cloud-resolving models better represent many of these processes and can now be run globally but only for short-term simulations of at most a few years because of computational limitations. Here we demonstrate that deep learning can be used to capture many advantages of cloud-resolving modeling at a fraction of the computational cost. We train a deep neural network to represent all atmospheric subgrid processes in a climate model by learning from a multiscale model in which convection is treated explicitly. The trained neural network then replaces the traditional subgrid parameterizations in a global general circulation model in which it freely interacts with the resolved dynamics and the surface-flux scheme. The prognostic multiyear simulations are stable and closely reproduce not only the mean climate of the cloud-resolving simulation but also key aspects of variability, including precipitation extremes and the equatorial wave spectrum. Furthermore, the neural network approximately conserves energy despite not being explicitly instructed to. Finally, we show that the neural network parameterization generalizes to new surface forcing patterns but struggles to cope with temperatures far outside its training manifold. Our results show the feasibility of using deep learning for climate model parameterization. In a broader context, we anticipate that data-driven Earth system model development could play a key role in reducing climate prediction uncertainty in the coming decade.},

versatile tool transforming industry applications and generating new and
improved capabilities for scientific discovery and model building. The
adoption of DL in hydrology has so far been gradual, but the field is now
ripe for breakthroughs. This paper suggests that DL-based methods can open up a
complementary avenue toward knowledge discovery in hydrologic sciences. In
the new avenue, machine-learning algorithms present competing hypotheses that
are consistent with data. Interrogative methods are then invoked to interpret
DL models for scientists to further evaluate. However, hydrology presents
many challenges for DL methods, such as data limitations, heterogeneity
and co-evolution, and the general inexperience of the hydrologic field with
DL. The roadmap toward DL-powered scientific advances will require the
coordinated effort from a large community involving scientists and citizens.
Integrating process-based models with DL models will help alleviate data
limitations. The sharing of data and baseline models will improve the
efficiency of the community as a whole. Open competitions could serve as the
organizing events to greatly propel growth and nurture data science education
in hydrology, which demands a grassroots collaboration. The area of
hydrologic DL presents numerous research opportunities that could, in turn,
stimulate advances in machine learning as well.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

              Glacier surface mass balance evaluated over the actual glacier geometry depends not only on climatic variations, but also on the dynamic adjustment of glacier geometry. Therefore, it has been proposed that reference-surface balances calculated over a constant glacier hypsometry are better suited for climatic interpretation. Here we present a comparison of 82 year modelled time series (1926-2008) of conventional and reference-surface balance for 36 Swiss glaciers. Over this time period the investigated glaciers have lost 22\% of their area, and ice surface elevation close to the current glacier terminus has decreased by 78 m on average. Conventional balance in the last decade, at −0.91 mw.e.a
              -1
              , is 0.14 m w.e. a
              -1
              less negative than the reference-surface balance. About half of the negative (stabilizing) feedback on mass balance due to glacier terminus retreat is compensated by more negative mass balances due to surface lowering. Short-term climatic variability is clearly reflected in the conventional mass-balance series; however, the magnitude of the long-term negative trend is underestimated compared to that found in the reference-surface balance series. Both conventional and reference-surface specific balances show large spatial variability among the 36 glaciers.},

This consistency is found throughout the entire common periods of the respective data sets. Inconsistencies of reconstructions and observations persist in estimates on regional scales.},

In an interpretable CNN, each filter in a high conv-layer represents a certain object part. We do not need any annotations of object parts or textures to supervise the learning process. Instead, the interpretable CNN automatically assigns each filter in a high conv-layer with an object part during the learning process. Our method can be applied to different types of CNNs with different structures. The clear knowledge representation in an interpretable CNN can help people understand the logics inside a CNN, i.e., based on which patterns the CNN makes the decision. Experiments showed that filters in an interpretable CNN were more semantically meaningful than those in traditional CNNs.},

Cloud-resolving models better represent many of these processes and can now be run globally but only for short-term simulations of at most a few years because of computational limitations. Here we demonstrate that deep learning can be used to capture many advantages of cloud-resolving modeling at a fraction of the computational cost. We train a deep neural network to represent all atmospheric subgrid processes in a climate model by learning from a multiscale model in which convection is treated explicitly. The trained neural network then replaces the traditional subgrid parameterizations in a global general circulation model in which it freely interacts with the resolved dynamics and the surface-flux scheme. The prognostic multiyear simulations are stable and closely reproduce not only the mean climate of the cloud-resolving simulation but also key aspects of variability, including precipitation extremes and the equatorial wave spectrum. Furthermore, the neural network approximately conserves energy despite not being explicitly instructed to. Finally, we show that the neural network parameterization generalizes to new surface forcing patterns but struggles to cope with temperatures far outside its training manifold. Our results show the feasibility of using deep learning for climate model parameterization. In a broader context, we anticipate that data-driven Earth system model development could play a key role in reducing climate prediction uncertainty in the coming decade.},

            Accurate estimations of ice thickness and volume are indispensable for ice flow modelling, hydrological forecasts and sea-level rise projections. We present a new ice thickness estimation model based on a mass-conserving forward model and a Bayesian inversion scheme. The forward model calculates flux in an elevation-band flow-line model, and translates this into ice thickness and surface ice speed using a shallow ice formulation. Both ice thickness and speed are then extrapolated to the map plane. The model assimilates observations of ice thickness and speed using a Bayesian scheme implemented with a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, which calculates estimates of ice thickness and their error. We illustrate the model's capabilities by applying it to a mountain glacier, validate the model using 733 glaciers from four regions with ice thickness measurements, and demonstrate that the model can be used for large-scale studies by fitting it to over 30 000 glaciers from five regions. The results show that the model performs best when a few thickness observations are available; that the proposed scheme by which parameter-knowledge from a set of glaciers is transferred to others works but has room for improvements; and that the inferred regional ice volumes are consistent with recent estimates.},

	abstract = {Detecting extreme events in large datasets is a major challenge in climate science research. Current algorithms for extreme event detection are build upon human expertise in defining events based on subjective thresholds of relevant physical variables. Often, multiple competing methods produce vastly different results on the same dataset. Accurate characterization of extreme events in climate simulations and observational data archives is critical for understanding the trends and potential impacts of such events in a climate change content. This study presents the first application of Deep Learning techniques as alternative methodology for climate extreme events detection. Deep neural networks are able to learn high-level representations of a broad class of patterns from labeled data. In this work, we developed deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification system and demonstrated the usefulness of Deep Learning technique for tackling climate pattern detection problems. Coupled with Bayesian based hyper-parameter optimization scheme, our deep CNN system achieves 89{\textbackslash}\%-99{\textbackslash}\% of accuracy in detecting extreme events (Tropical Cyclones, Atmospheric Rivers and Weather Fronts},

We present here our automated workflow designed to download data from institutional or commercial servers, prepare images, launch the feature tracking algorithm, calibrate glacier surface speeds, and our post-processing treatment to obtain filtered and time-averaged velocity maps. We applied our methodology to three regions: (1) the European alps; (2) the Peruvian Cordillera Blanca; and (3) the Southern Alps of New Zealand for years 2017 and 2018 and quantified ice velocity for every possible repeat cycle from few days up to 400 days. For these regions, we demonstrate the ability of our processing chain to derive precise time-averaged ice flow maps. The statistical analysis of the results provided by each individual repeat cycles shows that velocity mapping from Sentinel-2 is about twice more precise than that from Landsat 7/8. If Sentinel-2 captures more details than Landsat, some of the smallest glaciers ({\textless}250 m wide) remain challenging. Given the estimated precision for Sentinel-2, we also conclude that velocity fluctuations of the order of 10 m/yr can only be captured with repeat cycles longer than 60 days. Comparing Sentinel-2 with Pléiades, Planet and Ven   μ   s imagery, we finally highlight the advantages of high-resolution sensors to map glacier surface speed with finer details in space and time.},

In this paper, we illustrate an application of DNNMs to upper ocean dynamics, more precisely the dynamics of a sea surface tracer, the Sea Surface Height (SSH). We develop an advection-based fully differentiable numerical scheme, where parts of the computations can be replaced with learnable ConvNets, and make connections with the single-layer Quasi-Geostrophic (QG) model, a baseline theory in physical oceanography developed decades ago.},

	abstract = {In the context of science, the well-known adage "a picture is worth a thousand words" might well be "a model is worth a thousand datasets." Scientific models, such as Newtonian physics or biological gene regulatory networks, are human-driven simplifications of complex phenomena that serve as surrogates for the countless experiments that validated the models. Recently, machine learning has been able to overcome the inaccuracies of approximate modeling by directly learning the entire set of nonlinear interactions from data. However, without any predetermined structure from the scientific basis behind the problem, machine learning approaches are flexible but data-expensive, requiring large databases of homogeneous labeled training data. A central challenge is reconciling data that is at odds with simplified models without requiring "big data". In this work we develop a new methodology, universal differential equations (UDEs), which augments scientific models with machine-learnable structures for scientifically-based learning. We show how UDEs can be utilized to discover previously unknown governing equations, accurately extrapolate beyond the original data, and accelerate model simulation, all in a time and data-efficient manner. This advance is coupled with open-source software that allows for training UDEs which incorporate physical constraints, delayed interactions, implicitly-defined events, and intrinsic stochasticity in the model. Our examples show how a diverse set of computationally-difficult modeling issues across scientific disciplines, from automatically discovering biological mechanisms to accelerating climate simulations by 15,000x, can be handled by training UDEs.},

            The response of glaciers to climate change has major implications for sea-level change and water resources around the globe. Large-scale glacier evolution models are used to project glacier runoff and mass loss, but are constrained by limited observations, which result in models being over-parameterized. Recent systematic geodetic mass-balance observations provide an opportunity to improve the calibration of glacier evolution models. In this study, we develop a calibration scheme for a glacier evolution model using a Bayesian inverse model and geodetic mass-balance observations, which enable us to quantify model parameter uncertainty. The Bayesian model is applied to each glacier in High Mountain Asia using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. After 10,000 steps, the chains generate a sufficient number of independent samples to estimate the properties of the model parameters from the joint posterior distribution. Their spatial distribution shows a clear orographic effect indicating the resolution of climate data is too coarse to resolve temperature and precipitation at high altitudes. Given the glacier evolution model is over-parameterized, particular attention is given to identifiability and the need for future work to integrate additional observations in order to better constrain the plausible sets of model parameters.},

              Alpine glaciers are very sensitive to climate fluctuations, and their mass balance can be used as an indicator of regional-scale climate change. Here, we present a method to calculate glacier mass balance using remote-sensing data. Snowline measurements from remotely sensed images recorded at the end of the hydrological year provide an effective proxy of the equilibrium line. Mass balance can be deduced from the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) variations. Three well-documented glaciers in the French Alps, where the mass balance is measured at ground level with a stake network, were selected to assess the accuracy of the method over the 1994–2002 period (eight mass-balance cycles). Results obtained by ground measurements and remote sensing are compared and show excellent correlation (

              2
              {\textgreater} 0.89), both for the ELA and for the mass balance, indicating that the remote-sensing method can be applied to glaciers where no ground data exist, on the scale of a mountain range or a given climatic area. The main differences can be attributed to discrepancies between the dates of image acquisition and field measurements. Cloud cover and recent snowfalls constitute the main restrictions of the image-based method.},

	abstract = {Mapping snow cover (SC) on glaciers at the end of the ablation period provides a possibility to rapidly obtain a proxy for their equilibrium line altitude (ELA) which in turn is a metric for the mass balance. Satellite determination of glacier snow cover, derived over large regions, can reveal its spatial variability and temporal trends. Accordingly, snow mapping on glaciers has been widely applied using several satellite sensors. However, as glacier ice originates from compressed snow, both have very similar spectral properties and standard methods to map snow struggle to distinguish snow on glaciers. Hence, most studies applied manual delineation of snow extent on glaciers. Here we present an automated tool, named ‘ASMAG’ (automated snow mapping on glaciers), to map SC on glaciers and derive the related snow line altitude (SLA) for individual glaciers using multi-temporal Landsat satellite imagery and a digital elevation model (DEM). The method has been developed using the example of the Ötztal Alps, where an evaluation of the method is possible using field-based observations of the annual equilibrium line altitude (ELA) and the accumulation area ratio (AAR) measured for three glaciers for more than 30 years. The tool automatically selects a threshold to map snow on glaciers and robustly calculates the SLA based on the frequency distribution of elevation bins with more than 50\% SC. The accuracy of the SC mapping was about 90\% and the SLA was determined successfully in 80\% of all cases with a mean uncertainty of ±19 m. When cloud-free scenes close to the date of the highest snowline are available, a good to very good agreement of SC ratios (SCR)/SLA with field data of AAR/ELA are obtained, otherwise values are systematically higher/lower as useful images were often acquired too early in the summer season. However, glacier specific differences are still well captured. Snow mapping on glaciers is impeded by clouds and their shadows or when fresh snow is covering the glaciers, so that more frequent image acquisitions (as now provided by Sentinel-2) would improve results.},

            In this study we present 19 new or re-analysed series of glacier-wide seasonal mass balance for the Swiss Alps based on direct measurements. The records partly start around 1920 and continue until today. Previously unpublished and unevaluated observations of point winter and annual balance are compiled from various sources and archives. These highly valuable datasets have not yet been consistently evaluated and were thus unavailable to the scientific community. Using distributed modelling for spatial interpolation and extrapolation and homogenization of the point measurements, we infer continuous series of area-averaged mass balance. The results are validated against independent decadal ice volume changes from photogrammetric surveys. Six of the new seasonal series cover 60 years and more and add a substantial amount of information on the variations of regional glacier mass change. This will strengthen the worldwide collection of glacier monitoring data, especially for the data-sparse period before the 1980s. We compare our results to existing long-term series and present an updated assessment of mass-balance variability and glacier sensitivity throughout the European Alps.},

	abstract = {Abstract. We present a novel approach to simulate and reconstruct annual glacier-wide surface mass balance (SMB) series based on a deep artificial neural network (ANN; i.e. deep learning). This method has been included as the SMB component of an open-source regional glacier evolution model. While most glacier models tend to incorporate more and more physical processes, here we take an alternative approach by creating a parameterized model based on data science. Annual glacier-wide SMBs can be simulated from topo-climatic predictors using either deep learning or Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; regularized multilinear regression), whereas the glacier geometry is updated using a glacier-specific parameterization. We compare and cross-validate our nonlinear deep learning SMB model against other standard linear statistical methods on a dataset of 32 French Alpine glaciers. Deep learning is found to outperform linear methods, with improved explained variance (up to +64 \% in space and +108 \% in time) and accuracy (up to +47 \% in space and +58 \% in time), resulting in an estimated r2 of 0.77 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.51 m w.e. Substantial nonlinear structures are captured by deep learning, with around 35 \% of nonlinear behaviour in the temporal dimension. For the glacier geometry evolution, the main uncertainties come from the ice thickness data used to initialize the model. These results should encourage the use of deep learning in glacier modelling as a powerful nonlinear tool, capable of capturing the nonlinearities of the climate and glacier systems, that can serve to reconstruct or simulate SMB time series for individual glaciers in a whole region for past and future climates.},

	abstract = {Sea level rise contribution from the Antarctic ice sheet is influenced by changes in glacier and ice shelf front position. Still, little is known about seasonal glacier and ice shelf front fluctuations as the manual delineation of calving fronts from remote sensing imagery is very time-consuming. The major challenge of automatic calving front extraction is the low contrast between floating glacier and ice shelf fronts and the surrounding sea ice. Additionally, in previous decades, remote sensing imagery over the often cloud-covered Antarctic coastline was limited. Nowadays, an abundance of Sentinel-1 imagery over the Antarctic coastline exists and could be used for tracking glacier and ice shelf front movement. To exploit the available Sentinel-1 data, we developed a processing chain allowing automatic extraction of the Antarctic coastline from Seninel-1 imagery and the creation of dense time series to assess calving front change. The core of the proposed workflow is a modified version of the deep learning architecture U-Net. This convolutional neural network (CNN) performs a semantic segmentation on dual-pol Sentinel-1 data and the Antarctic TanDEM-X digital elevation model (DEM). The proposed method is tested for four training and test areas along the Antarctic coastline. The automatically extracted fronts deviate on average 78 m in training and 108 m test areas. Spatial and temporal transferability is demonstrated on an automatically extracted 15-month time series along the Getz Ice Shelf. Between May 2017 and July 2018, the fronts along the Getz Ice Shelf show mostly an advancing tendency with the fastest moving front of DeVicq Glacier with 726 ± 20 m/yr.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The calving fronts of many tidewater glaciers in
Greenland have been undergoing strong seasonal and interannual
fluctuations. Conventionally, calving front positions have been manually
delineated from remote sensing images. But manual practices can be
labor-intensive and time-consuming, particularly when processing a large
number of images taken over decades and covering large areas with many
glaciers, such as Greenland. Applying U-Net, a deep learning architecture,
to multitemporal synthetic aperture radar images taken by the TerraSAR-X
satellite, we here automatically delineate the calving front positions of
Jakobshavn Isbræ from 2009 to 2015. Our results are consistent with the
manually delineated products generated by the Greenland Ice Sheet Climate
Change Initiative project. We show that the calving fronts of Jakobshavn's
two main branches retreated at mean rates of -117±1 and
-157±1 m yr−1, respectively, during the years 2009 to 2015. The
interannual calving front variations can be roughly divided into three
phases for both branches. The retreat rates of the two branches tripled and
doubled, respectively, from phase 1 (April 2009–January 2011) to phase 2
(January 2011–January 2013) and then stabilized to nearly zero in phase 3
(January 2013–December 2015). We suggest that the retreat of the calving
front into an overdeepened basin whose bed is retrograde may have
accelerated the retreat after 2011, while the inland–uphill bed slope behind
the bottom of the overdeepened basin has prevented the glacier from
retreating further after 2012. Demonstrating through this successful case
study on Jakobshavn Isbræ and due to the transferable nature of deep
learning, our methodology can be applied to many other tidewater glaciers
both in Greenland and elsewhere in the world, using multitemporal and
multisensor remote sensing imagery.},

This effort has been mostly restricted to the slow and painstaking manual digitalization of the calving front positions in thousands of satellite imagery products. Here, we have developed a machine learning toolkit to automatically detect glacier calving front margins in satellite imagery. The toolkit is based on semantic image segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with a modified U-Net architecture to isolate the calving fronts from satellite images after having been trained with a dataset of images and their corresponding manually-determined calving fronts. As a case study we train our neural network on a varied set of Landsat images with lowered resolutions from Jakobshavn, Sverdrup, and Kangerlussuaq glaciers, Greenland and test the results on images from Helheim glacier, Greenland to evaluate the performance of the approach. The neural network is able to identify the calving front in new images with a mean deviation of 96.3 m from the true fronts, equivalent to 1.97 pixels on average, while the corresponding error for manually-determined fronts on the same resolution images is 92.5 m (1.89 pixels). We find that the trained neural network significantly outperforms common edge detection techniques, and can be used to continuously map out calving-ice fronts with a variety of data products.},

Our super-resolution deep convolutional neural network model is trained on scattered regions in Antarctica where high resolution (250\&amp;\#8201;m) groundtruth bed elevation grids are available. The model is then used to generate high resolution bed topography in less well surveyed areas. DeepBedMap improves on previous interpolation methods by not restricting itself to a low spatial resolution (1000\&amp;\#8201;m) BEDMAP2 raster image as its prior. It takes in additional high spatial resolution datasets, such as ice surface elevation, velocity and snow accumulation to better inform the bed topography even in the absence of ice-thickness data from direct ice-penetrating radar surveys. Our DeepBedMap model is based on an adapted Enhanced Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network architecture, chosen to minimize per-pixel elevation errors while producing realistic topography. The final product is a four times upsampled (250\&amp;\#8201;m) bed elevation model of Antarctica that can be used by glaciologists interested in the subglacial terrain, and by ice sheet modellers wanting to run catchment or continent-scale ice sheet model simulations. We show that DeepBedMap offers a more realistic topographic roughness profile compared to a standard bicubic interpolated BEDMAP2 and BedMachine Antarctica, and envision it to be used where a high resolution bed elevation model is required.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

	abstract = {Abstract. In response to climate change, most glaciers are losing mass and hence contribute to sea-level rise. Repeated and accurate mapping of their surface topography is required to estimate their mass balance and to extrapolate/calibrate sparse field glaciological measurements. In this study we evaluate the potential of sub-meter stereo imagery from the recently launched Pléiades satellites to derive digital elevation models (DEMs) of glaciers and their elevation changes. Our five evaluation sites, where nearly simultaneous field measurements were collected, are located in Iceland, the European Alps, the central Andes, Nepal and Antarctica. For Iceland, the Pléiades DEM is also compared to a lidar DEM. The vertical biases of the Pléiades DEMs are less than 1 m if ground control points (GCPs) are used, but reach up to 7 m without GCPs. Even without GCPs, vertical biases can be reduced to a few decimetres by horizontal and vertical co-registration of the DEMs to reference altimetric data on ice-free terrain. Around these biases, the vertical precision of the Pléiades DEMs is ±1 m and even ±0.5 m on the flat glacier tongues (1σ confidence level). Similar precision levels are obtained in the accumulation areas of glaciers and in Antarctica. We also demonstrate the high potential of Pléiades DEMs for measuring seasonal, annual and multi-annual elevation changes with an accuracy of 1 m or better if cloud-free images are available. The negative region-wide mass balances of glaciers in the Mont-Blanc area (−1.04 ± 0.23 m a−1 water equivalent, w.e.) are revealed by differencing Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre 5 (SPOT 5) and Pléiades DEMs acquired in August 2003 and 2012, confirming the accelerated glacial wastage in the European Alps.},

	abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;\&lt;strong\&gt;Abstract.\&lt;/strong\&gt; Glacier surface mass balance (SMB) data are crucial to understand and quantify the regional effects of climate on glaciers and the high-mountain water cycle, yet observations cover only a small fraction of glaciers in the world. We present a dataset of annual glacier-wide surface mass balance of all the glaciers in the French Alps for the 1967\&amp;\#8211;2015 period. This dataset has been reconstructed using deep learning (i.e. a deep artificial neural network), based on direct and remote sensing SMB observations, meteorological reanalyses and topographical data from glacier inventories. This data science reconstruction approach is embedded as a SMB component of the open-source ALpine Parameterized Glacier Model (ALPGM). An extensive cross-validation allowed to assess the method\&amp;\#8217;s validity, with an estimated average error (RMSE) of 0.49\&amp;\#8201;m\&amp;\#8201;w.e.\&amp;\#8201;a\&lt;sup\&gt;\&amp;\#8722;1\&lt;/sup\&gt;, an explained variance (\&lt;i\&gt;r\&lt;/i\&gt;\&lt;sup\&gt;2\&lt;/sup\&gt;) of 79\&amp;\#8201;\% and an average bias of +0.017\&amp;\#8201;m\&amp;\#8201;w.e.\&amp;\#8201;a\&lt;sup\&gt;\&amp;\#8722;1\&lt;/sup\&gt;. We estimate an average regional area-weighted glacier-wide SMB of \&amp;\#8722;0.72\&amp;\#8201;\&amp;\#177;\&amp;\#8201;0.20\&amp;\#8201;m\&amp;\#8201;w.e.\&amp;\#8201;a\&lt;sup\&gt;\&amp;\#8722;1\&lt;/sup\&gt; for the 1967\&amp;\#8211;2015 period, with moderately negative mass balances in the 1970s (\&amp;\#8722;0.52\&amp;\#8201;m\&amp;\#8201;w.e.\&amp;\#8201;a\&lt;sup\&gt;\&amp;\#8722;1\&lt;/sup\&gt;) and 1980s (\&amp;\#8722;0.12\&amp;\#8201;m\&amp;\#8201;w.e.\&amp;\#8201;a\&lt;sup\&gt;\&amp;\#8722;1\&lt;/sup\&gt;), and an increasing negative trend from the 1990s onwards, up to \&amp;\#8722;1.39\&amp;\#8201;m\&amp;\#8201;w.e.\&amp;\#8201;a\&lt;sup\&gt;\&amp;\#8722;1\&lt;/sup\&gt; in the 2010s. Following a topographical and regional analysis, we estimate that the massifs with the highest mass losses for this period are the Chablais (\&amp;\#8722;0.90\&amp;\#8201;m\&amp;\#8201;w.e.\&amp;\#8201;a\&lt;sup\&gt;\&amp;\#8722;1\&lt;/sup\&gt;) and Ubaye and Champsaur ranges (\&amp;\#8722;0.91\&amp;\#8201;m\&amp;\#8201;w.e.\&amp;\#8201;a\&lt;sup\&gt;\&amp;\#8722;1\&lt;/sup\&gt; both), and the ones presenting the lowest mass losses are the Mont-Blanc (\&amp;\#8722;0.74\&amp;\#8201;m\&amp;\#8201;w.e.\&amp;\#8201;a\&lt;sup\&gt;\&amp;\#8722;1\&lt;/sup\&gt;), Oisans and Haute-Tarentaise ranges (\&amp;\#8722;0.78\&amp;\#8201;m\&amp;\#8201;w.e.\&amp;\#8201;a\&lt;sup\&gt;\&amp;\#8722;1\&lt;/sup\&gt; both).

	abstract = {Studying glacier mass changes at regional scale provides critical insights into the impact of climate change on glacierized regions, but is impractical using in situ estimates alone due to logistical and human constraints. We present annual mass-balance time series for 239 glaciers in the European Alps, using optical satellite images for the period of 2000 to 2016. Our approach, called the SLA-method, is based on the estimation of the glacier snowline altitude (SLA) for each year combined with the geodetic mass balance over the study period to derive the annual mass balance. In situ annual mass-balances from 23 glaciers were used to validate our approach and underline its robustness to generate annual mass-balance time series. Such temporally-resolved observations provide a unique potential to investigate the behavior of glaciers in regions where few or no data are available. At the European Alps scale, our geodetic estimate was performed for 361 glaciers (75\% of the glacierized area) and indicates a mean annual mass loss of −0.74 ± 0.20 m w.e. yr$^{\textrm{–1}}$ from 2000 to 2016. The spatial variability in the average glacier mass loss is significantly correlated to three morpho-topographic variables (mean glacier slope, median, and maximum altitudes), altogether explaining 36\% of the observed variance. Comparing the mass losses from in situ and SLA-method estimates and taking into account the glacier slope and maximum elevation, we show that steeper glaciers and glaciers with higher maximum elevation experienced less mass loss. Because steeper glaciers ({\textgreater}20°) are poorly represented by in situ estimates, we suggest that region-wide extrapolation of field measurements could be improved by including a morpho-topographic dependency. The analysis of the annual mass changes with regard to a global atmospheric dataset (ERA5) showed that: (i) extreme climate events are registered by all glaciers across the European Alps, and we identified opposite weather regimes favorable or detrimental to the mass change; (ii) the interannual variability of glacier mass balances in the “central European Alps” is lower; and (iii) current strong imbalance of glaciers in the European Alps is likely mainly the consequence of the multi-decadal increasing trend in atmospheric temperature, clearly documented from ERA5 data.},

	abstract = {Neural networks have become increasingly prevalent within the geosciences, although a common limitation of their usage has been a lack of methods to interpret what the networks learn and how they make decisions. As such, neural networks have often been used within the geosciences to most accurately identify a desired output given a set of inputs, with the interpretation of what the network learns used as a secondary metric to ensure the network is making the right decision for the right reason. Neural network interpretation techniques have become more advanced in recent years, however, and we therefore propose that the ultimate objective of using a neural network can also be the interpretation of what the network has learned rather than the output itself. We show that the interpretation of neural networks can enable the discovery of scientifically meaningful connections within geoscientific data. In particular, we use two methods for neural network interpretation called backwards optimization and layerwise relevance propagation, both of which project the decision pathways of a network back onto the original input dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, LRP has not yet been applied to geoscientific research, and we believe it has great potential in this area. We show how these interpretation techniques can be used to reliably infer scientifically meaningful information from neural networks by applying them to common climate patterns. These results suggest that combining interpretable neural networks with novel scientific hypotheses will open the door to many new avenues in neural network-related geoscience research.},

	abstract = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

	abstract = {Climate change in the European Alps during recent years has led to decreased snow cover duration as well as increases in the frequency and intensity of summer heat waves. The risk of drought for alpine wetlands and temporary pools, which rely on water from snowmelt and provide habitat for specialist plant and amphibian biodiversity, is largely unknown and understudied in this context. Here, we test and validate a novel application of Sentinel-2 imagery aimed at quantifying seasonal variation in water surface area in the context of 95 small (median surface area {\textless}100 m2) and shallow (median depth of 20 cm) alpine wetlands in the French Alps, using a linear spectral unmixing approach. For three study years (2016–2018), we used path-analysis to correlate mid-summer water surface area to annual metrics of snowpack (depth and duration) and spring and summer climate (temperature and precipitation). We further sought to evaluate potential biotic responses to drought for study years by monitoring the survival of common frog (Rana temporaria) tadpoles and wetland plant biomass production quantified using peak Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We found strong agreement between citizen science-based observations of water surface area and Sentinel-2 based estimates (R2 = 0.8–0.9). Mid-summer watershed snow cover duration and summer temperatures emerged as the most important factors regulating alpine wetland hydrology, while the effects of summer precipitation, and local and watershed snow melt-out timing were not significant. We found that a lack of summer snowfields in 2017 combined with a summer heat wave resulted in a significant decrease in mid-summer water surface area, and led to the drying up of certain wetlands as well as the observed mortality of tadpoles. We did not observe a negative effect of the 2017 summer on the biomass production of wetland vegetation, suggesting that wetlands that maintain soil moisture may act as favorable microhabitats for above treeline vegetation during dry years. Our work introduces a remote sensing-based protocol for monitoring the surface hydrology of alpine wetland habitats at the regional scale. Given that climate models predict continued reduction of snow cover in the Alps during the coming years, as well as particularly intense warming during the summer months, our conclusions underscore the vulnerability of alpine wetlands in the face of ongoing climate change.},

	abstract = {Abstract. It is standard to compare climate model results covering
the past millennium and reconstructions based on various archives in order
to test the ability of models to reproduce the observed climate variability.
Up to now, glacier length fluctuations have not been used systematically in
this framework even though they offer information on multi-decadal to
centennial variations complementary to other records. One reason is that
glacier length depends on several complex factors and so cannot be directly
linked to the simulated climate. However, climate model skill can be
measured by comparing the glacier length computed by a glacier model driven
by simulated temperature and precipitation to observed glacier length
variations. This is done here using the version 1.0 of the Open Global Glacier
Model (OGGM) forced by fields derived from a range of simulations performed
with global climate models over the past millennium. The glacier model is
applied to a set of Alpine glaciers for which observations cover at least
the 20th century. The observed glacier length fluctuations are
generally well within the range of the simulations driven by the various
climate model results, showing a general consistency with this ensemble of
simulations. Sensitivity experiments indicate that the results are much more
sensitive to the simulated climate than to OGGM parameters. This confirms
that the simulations of glacier length can be used to evaluate the climate
model performance, in particular the simulated summer temperatures that
largely control the glacier changes in our region of interest. Simulated
glacier length is strongly influenced by the internal variability in the
system, putting limitations on the model–data comparison for some variables
like the trends over the 20th century in the Alps. Nevertheless,
comparison of glacier length fluctuations on longer timescales, for instance
between the 18th century and the late 20th century, appear less
influenced by the natural variability and indicate clear differences in the
behaviour of the various climate models.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Extreme low and high flows can have negative economic, social, and ecological effects and are expected to become more severe in many regions due to climate change. Besides low and high flows, the whole flow regime, i.e., annual hydrograph comprised of monthly mean flows, is subject to changes. Knowledge on future changes in flow regimes is important since regimes contain information on both extremes and conditions prior to the dry and wet seasons. Changes in individual low- and high-flow characteristics as well as flow regimes under mean conditions have been thoroughly studied. In contrast, little is known about changes in extreme flow regimes. We here propose two methods for the estimation of extreme flow regimes and apply them to simulated discharge time series for future climate conditions in Switzerland. The first method relies on frequency analysis performed on annual flow duration curves. The second approach performs frequency analysis of the discharge sums of a large set of stochastically generated annual hydrographs. Both approaches were found to produce similar 100-year regime estimates when applied to a data set of 19 hydrological regions in Switzerland. Our results show that changes in both extreme low- and high-flow regimes for rainfall-dominated regions are distinct from those in melt-dominated regions. In rainfall-dominated regions, the minimum discharge of low-flow regimes decreases by up to 50 \%, whilst the reduction is 25 \% for high-flow regimes. In contrast, the maximum discharge of low- and high-flow regimes increases by up to 50 \%. In melt-dominated regions, the changes point in the other direction than those in rainfall-dominated regions. The minimum and maximum discharges of extreme regimes increase by up to 100 \% and decrease by less than 50 \%, respectively. Our findings provide guidance in water resource planning and management and the extreme regime estimates are a valuable basis for climate impact studies. Highlights
 Estimation of 100-year low- and high-flow regimes using annual flow duration curves and stochastically simulated discharge time series Both mean and extreme regimes will change under future climate conditions. The minimum discharge of extreme regimes will decrease in rainfall-dominated regions but increase in melt-dominated regions. The maximum discharge of extreme regimes will increase and decrease in rainfall-dominated and melt-dominated regions, respectively.},

It covers from the genesis of neural networks when associationism modeling of the brain is studied, to the models that dominate the last decade of research in deep learning like convolutional neural networks, deep belief networks, and recurrent neural networks. In addition to a review of these models, this paper primarily focuses on the precedents of the models above, examining how the initial ideas are assembled to construct the early models and how these preliminary models are developed into their current forms. Many of these evolutionary paths last more than half a century and have a diversity of directions. For example, CNN is built on prior knowledge of biological vision system; DBN is evolved from a trade-off of modeling power and computation complexity of graphical models and many nowadays models are neural counterparts of ancient linear models. This paper reviews these evolutionary paths and offers a concise thought flow of how these models are developed, and aims to provide a thorough background for deep learning. More importantly, along with the path, this paper summarizes the gist behind these milestones and proposes many directions to guide the future research of deep learning.},

	abstract = {Abstract. In high mountainous catchments, the spatial precipitation and therefore the overall water balance is generally difficult to estimate. The present paper describes the structure and calibration of a semi-lumped conceptual glacio-hydrological model for the joint simulation of daily discharge and annual glacier mass balance that represents a better integrator of the water balance. The model has been developed for climate change impact studies and has therefore a parsimonious structure; it requires three input times series - precipitation, temperature and potential evapotranspiration - and has 7 parameters to calibrate. A multi-signal approach considering daily discharge and - if available - annual glacier mass balance has been developed for the calibration of these parameters. The model has been calibrated for three different catchments in the Swiss Alps having glaciation rates between 37\% and 52\%. It simulates well the observed daily discharge, the hydrological regime and some basic glaciological features, such as the annual mass balance.},
